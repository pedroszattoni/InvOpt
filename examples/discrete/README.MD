# `discrete`

>Warning: the `discrete` function requires `gurobipy`.

## Use case

This function can be used when the FOP is of the form

$$
\min_ {x \in \mathbb{X}(\hat{s})} \ \langle \theta,\phi(\hat{s},x) \rangle,
$$

where $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^p$, $\phi: \mathbb{S} \times \mathbb{X} \to \mathbb{R}^p$ is the feature mapping, and the constraint set $\mathbb{X}(\hat{s}) \subseteq \mathbb{X}$ is discrete, that is, we can list all elements in this set.

## Solution method


See [`mixed_integer_linear`](https://github.com/pedroszattoni/invopt/tree/main/examples/mixed_integer_linear) (or [`mixed_integer_quadratic`](https://github.com/pedroszattoni/invopt/tree/main/examples/mixed_integer_quadratic)), i.e., the solution method for the `discrete` function can be seen as a special case of the `mixed_integer_linear` (or `mixed_integer_quadratic`) function, for the case when the decision vector has no continuous components.

## Example: binary linear program with inconsistent data

In the file `binary_LP_inconsistent_data.py`, you will find an example usage of the `discrete` function. For this example, the dataset $\mathcal{D} = \\{(\hat{s}_ i, \hat{x}_ i)\\}_ {i=1}^N$ is generated by solving the binary linear program

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{x}_ i \in \arg\min_ {x} \quad &  \langle \theta + \sigma_ i,x \rangle \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & \hat{A}_ i x \leq \hat{b}_ i \\
& x \in \\{0,1\\}^n,
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\hat{s}_ i = (\hat{A}_ i, \hat{b}_ i)$, $\phi(\hat{s},x)=x$ and $\sigma_i$ is a Gaussian noise vector. The IO problem is solved using the Augmented Suboptimality loss and Suboptimality loss reformulations. For a detailed description of this example, please see [Zattoni Scroccaro et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07730).
