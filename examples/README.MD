# InvOpt functions

The following functions are available in the InvOpt package for solving IO problems:

- [`discrete_model_consistent`](https://github.com/pedroszattoni/invopt/tree/main/examples/discrete_model_consistent): for FOPs with dicrete decision spaces (e.g., binary), and when the dataset is consistent with some cost vector.
- [`discrete_model`](https://github.com/pedroszattoni/invopt/tree/main/examples/discrete_model): for FOPs with dicrete decision spaces (e.g., binary).
- [`MIP_linear`](https://github.com/pedroszattoni/invopt/tree/main/examples/MIP_linear): for mixed-integer FOPs, with cost function linear w.r.t. the continuous part of the decision variable.
- [`MIP_quadratic`](https://github.com/pedroszattoni/invopt/tree/main/examples/MIP_quadratic): for mixed-integer FOPs, with cost function quadratic w.r.t. the continuous part of the decision variable.
- [`FOM`](https://github.com/pedroszattoni/invopt/tree/main/examples/FOM): first-order methods for general FOPs.
