# `continuous_quadratic`

>Warning: the `continuous_quadratic` function requires `cvxpy`.

## Use case

This function can be used when the FOP is of the form

$$
\min_ {x \in \mathbb{X}(\hat{s})} \ \langle \theta, \phi(\hat{s}, x)\rangle 
$$

with a continuous constraint set

$$
\mathbb{X}(\hat{s}) = \left\\{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n : \hat{A}x \leq \hat{b} \right\\},
$$

where the signal in the form $\hat{s} = (\hat{A}, \hat{b}, \hat{w})$, and the hypothesis function is in the form

$$
\langle \theta,\phi(\hat{s}, x) \rangle = \langle x,Q_ {xx} x \rangle  + \langle x,Q \phi_ 1(\hat{w}) \rangle,
$$

where $Q_ {xx} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is PSD, $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$, $\phi_ 1 : \mathbb{W} \to \mathbb{R}^m$ is a feature mapping, $\theta = [\text{vec}(Q_ {xx}) \ \ \text{vec}(Q)] \in \mathbb{R}^p$, and $\phi(\hat{s}, x) = [x \otimes x \quad \phi_ 1(\hat{w}) \otimes x]$, where $\otimes$ is the Kronecker product.

## Solution method


See [`mixed_integer_quadratic`](https://github.com/pedroszattoni/invopt/tree/main/examples/mixed_integer_quadratic), i.e., the solution method for the `quadratic_linear` function can be seen as a special case of the `mixed_integer_quadratic` function, for the case when the decision vector has no integer components.

## Example: quadratic program

In the file `QP.py`, you will find an example usage of the `continuous_quadratic` function. For this example, the dataset $\mathcal{D} = \\{(\hat{s}_ i, \hat{x}_ i)\\}_ {i=1}^N$ is generated by solving the binary quadratic program

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{x}_ i \in \arg\min_ {x} \quad &  \langle x,Q_{xx} x \rangle  + \langle x,q \rangle \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & \hat{A}_ i x \leq \hat{b}_ i \\
& 0 \leq x \leq 1,
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\hat{s}_ i = ([\hat{A}_ i^\top \ \ I \ \ -I]^\top, [\hat{b}_ i \ \ \mathbf{1} \ \ \mathbf{0}], 0)$, where $\mathbf{1}$ is the vector of ones and $\mathbf{0}$ is the vector of zeros. The IO problem is solved using the solution methods presented above, with $Q = q$ and $\phi_ 1(\hat{w}) = 1$. The way the synthetic data is generated and the way the results are evaluated follow the same template as the numerical experiments in [Zattoni Scroccaro et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07730).
